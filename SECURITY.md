# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 3.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Basicly, send an email to `richard@teknoo.software` with the vulnerability description and a proof of concept of the exploit.
This is a free project, written on my free time, so: there are no bug bounty, but you will be credited in the version's description, changelog and the contributors list.

Thanks
